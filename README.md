# Super Admin
Super Admin is a role that is reserved for maintainers of the system. This role allows them to add new colleges to the system and remove existing colleges as needed. As the name suggests, this role has the highest level of access and authority within the system, and is therefore only available to a select few individuals who are responsible for maintaining and managing the platform. By giving these maintainers the ability to manage the colleges within the system, Super Admin ensures that the platform is kept up-to-date and running smoothly.

# College Admin
College admin is a role that is assigned to a specific individual within each college who is responsible for managing and maintaining the college's presence on the platform. Unlike other users, college admins cannot register for an account on their own; instead, they must be added by a super admin. Once added, a college admin has the ability to send announcements to all users within their college, excluding super admins. They can also delete any announcements made by other users within their college.

In addition to managing announcements, college admins can add and remove courses within their college. In order to sign up for the platform, students must be enrolled in at least one course. The college admin is also responsible for approving faculty accounts, after which faculty members can access their accounts.

Finally, college admins can add and remove custom roles for students within their college. These roles can be assigned using the student's email address, and can be used to grant students access to specific features and capabilities within the platform. For example, a college admin might create a "student council" role that grants students access to a student council chat. There is also a built-in "class representative" role that can be easily assigned to students, making it easier for college admins to manage class representatives within their college.

# Faculty
Faculty is a role within the platform that is assigned to individuals who are responsible for teaching courses at a college. Faculty members have the ability to make announcements to other faculty members within their college, and can also participate in a faculty-only chat. In order to sign up for the platform, faculty members must first have their accounts approved by a college admin. Once their account has been approved, they can log in and access the platform's features and capabilities.

As faculty members, they have access to tools and resources that are specifically designed to help them connect with their students and manage their courses. This includes the ability to make announcements and participate in the faculty-only chat, as well as other features and capabilities that are designed to support their teaching efforts. By providing these tools and resources, the platform aims to support and enhance the work of faculty members, helping them to connect with their students and support their academic success.

# Student
Students are the primary users of the platform, and can register for an account with minimal personal information. Once they have signed up, they can log in and access the platform's various features and capabilities. This includes the ability to participate in chat rooms, view announcements targeted to them, and make announcements of their own if they have been granted permission to do so.

Students have access to class-specific and course-specific chat rooms, as well as a college-wide chat room, which allows them to connect with other students at their college. Students who have been assigned certain roles, such as the "student council" role, may also have access to additional chat rooms and features. For example, students with the "announcement" role may be able to send announcements to all students within their college, or to specific classes based on their assigned roles.

Overall, the platform is designed to provide students with a range of tools and resources that can help them connect with their peers, teachers, and other members of the college community. By providing these tools and resources, the platform aims to support and enhance the student experience, helping students to stay connected and engaged with their college community.
